EM::Rserve is an attempt to bring RServe over EventMachine.
Consider it a development version.

So far it can:
- connect to a server
- detach and reattach a session
- parse most low-level messages
- parse most R' S-expressions to a ruby tree
- translate some common R' S-expressions to "base" ruby objects such as arrays, strings, hashes ...
- translate some simple Ruby objects (arrays of integers, strings etc.) to R' S-expression
- evaluate strings of R code
