EM::Rserve is an attempt to bring RServe over EventMachine.
Consider it a somewhat stable version.

EM::Rserve is pure-ruby and should work wherever EventMachine is supported.

So far it can:
- connect to a server
- detach and reattach a session
- parse most low-level messages
- parse most R' S-expressions to a ruby tree
- translate several common R' S-expressions to "base" ruby objects such as arrays, strings, hashes ...
- translate several Ruby objects (arrays of integers, strings etc.) to R' S-expression
- evaluate strings of R code
- handle pools of connections with ruby fibers

Limitations:
- no support for the connections with a password. somehow, password without encryption defeats the purpose. hence, if you need a password, you should setup an SSH proxy instead
