* missing types
* special handling in ruby2r translator
  - Factor
  - Table
* RESP_ERR as a flag and not an OR-ed value
  -> will need to modify Header#error? and Header#error
* factorize headers parsing/dumping for SEXP and QAP1 parameters
* login command
  support crypt and store salt from connection setup
* better attach method
* more spec once the RServe spec is better understood/have enough examples
* subclass Request for each commmand instead of current quick'n dirty mechanism
* better test requests stacking/unstacking
